\abstract{On Android it may be possible to obtain the SSL session keys by scanning and parsing the process memory of a running application. We would like to investigate whether it is possible to recover the keys to decode captured network traffic of SSL sessions.}


\section{Research question}

\begin{framed}
\noindent \textit{How can we obtain the SSL sessions keys from the process memory of an running Android application?}
\end{framed}
Our research is going to include the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Investigate the architecture of Android processes, related work, and methods of analysing the application memory.}
\item{Set up the test environment.}
\item{Run specific tests to verify the functionality of the whole application.}
\item{Drawing conclusions, which indicate how close we finally got comparing to our initial goal. And writing the report.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related work}
The article by Gursev Singh Kalra, titled "Extracting RSAPrivateCrtKey and Certificates from an Android Process", describes how to dump X.509 certificates and construct a RSA private key (RSAPrivateCrtKey) from the Android application memory using Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT) and Java code.\cite{cite1}

\section{Planning}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | m{11cm}|  } 
\hline
Week & Work \\ 
\hline
1 & Start by looking at RFID implementation, deciding how data are going to be structured, looking at Android SDK and investigate encryptions methods and libraries. Also, we are going to decide how the design of the application is going to be. \\ 
\hline
& Start the development of a prototype application in an incremental approach.\\
2 & \textbf{Phase 1 of 2nd week:} Test the writing/reading procedure on the card using plaintext.\\
& \textbf{Phase 2 of 2nd week:} Implement encryption/decryption.\\ 
\hline
3 & Finalize the software application and run complete tests on the whole functionality.\\ 
\hline
4 & Writing the report, making conclusions, start writing down our test results and preparing the presentation. \\
\hline

\section{Tools and Equipment}
We intend to use an Android smartphone for memory analysis in combination with a heap analyzer (i.e. Eclipse Memory Analyzer), in order to find memory leaks and see if we can extract the SSL keys.
