\abstract{Today RFID tags are used in many places where a user has to be authenticated. Use cases include granting access to rooms or making payments off the card holder's bank account. The University of Amsterdam (UvA) uses RFID technology in their student identification cards. These cards grant access to particular rooms and and are able to make payments. This research will investigate the security of these cards and the possible weaknesses.}
\section{Research question}


\begin{framed}
\noindent \textit{Is the UvA card duplicable and can information on the card be manipulated to get different user rights?}
\end{framed}
Our research will be include the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Investigate what can be read from the cards and how data is structured.}
\item{Make a copy of UvA card and investigate the behaviour when using university facilities. This would
reveal what information is used by the facilities (UID of the card or some other information)}
\item{Finally, investigate the possibilities of manipulating data on the card (including a manipulated copy).}
\end{enumerate}
